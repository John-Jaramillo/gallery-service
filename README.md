# Gallery Service

This project implements a simple REST web service supporting uploading and retrieving of files. It is implemented as a Spring Boot resource server, with image browsing/retrieval endpoints unsecured, and other endpoints secured by OAuth 2.0.
 
 This is intended as an example for implementation of a Spring Boot-, Spring MVC-, Spring Data-based REST service that accepts file uploads, storing the files in the filesystem, and storing references to the files in a database.
